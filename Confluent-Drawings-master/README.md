# Confluent Drawings for Network Visualization

This is an implementation of the paper "Towards Unambiguous Edge Bundling: Investigating
Confluent Drawings for Network Visualization".

### Visit https://confluent-graphs.herokuapp.com/

(Note: On Heroku the graph nodes may not be fully seperated due to network lag etc. For better results run locally.)

### To run locally
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ArpanMangal/CD_NetworkVisualization.git
    $ cd CD_NetworkVisualization
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
```
Visit http://localhost:3000/

## TODOs -

1. Extend for Directed Graphs.
2. ~~Make the power-graph generation automatic.~~
3. Make bundles having more edges thicker.
4. Increase repulsive force for better node seperation.
5. After node splitting the graph becomes inverted. Debug it.
